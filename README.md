# dent: Design of equivalence and noninferiority tests

This package implements fast power and sample size calculations for equivalence and noninferiority tests faciliated via two and one one-sided t-tests, respectively. Accomodates balanced and imbalanced sample
size determination for two groups of data with equal and unequal variances. Test with paired data and single samples are also supported. Parallel and crossover designs are accommodated, along with functionality to analyze data from these designs.

You can install this version from Github:
